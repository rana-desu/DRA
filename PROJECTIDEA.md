# Disaster Resource Allocation Tool

An intelligent resource allocation tool that prioritizes distribution of relief supplies based on real-time needs accessed via crowdsourced data.

> This resource allocation tool primarily concerns with the disasters people face in india. [subject-to-change]

## Crowdsourced Data
1. ### Data Collection Sources
    1. A user-interface like website or mobile apps.
    2. Newschannels (RSS Feed).
    3. Scouting helicopters with a pre-established channel.

2. ### Data Categories
    1. Type of disaster
        1. Pre-defined precautions.
        2. Rescue & Resource type.
    2. Number of people stuck in disaster.
        1. Amount
        2. Location/Coords
    3. On basis of injury.
        1. Type of injury caused
        2. Amount
    4. Categories of people (priority-based).

## Classification
### Resources
1. Food support.
2. Medical support.
3. Emergency evacuation.

### Disasters
1. Heavy Rainfalls -> Floods.
2. Strong Winds & Heavy Rainfalls -> Cyclones.
3. Landslides.
4. Heatwaves.
5. Earthquakes.
6. Heavy Snowfalls.
7. Forest Fires.

## Generalised Priority Calculation (independent of disaster types)
### Class Models
1. Food Supply Prioritization: `starvation_priority()` <br>
Makes decision about how many people are currently surviving and to whom the food should be supplied.
    1. Number of Days <br>
    Threshold: If starving for 3+ days, then food delivery is a MUST/mandatory.
    2. Number of People <br>
    Threshold: Availaibility of ration resources.
    3. Type of people (Child, Older Citizens, Adult)
    3. Location from base to affected location. <br>
    example: <br>
    Considering 2 people starving for 5-7 days, and 10 people starving for 1-2 days: 2 people gets priority.
    
2. Medical Support Prioritization: `medical_priority()`
3. Evacuation Prioritization: `evacuation_priority()`

## Implementation
### BACKEND
1. Integrate INSAT-3D weather data + NDMA risk maps.
2. Use crowdsourced reports (e.g., MyGov Sahyog app).
3. Prioritize responses via severity scores (floods > heatwaves > pollution).
4. Data filtering.

### UI/UX
1. Person data gathering.
    1. Single and Multi, both.

### Dataflow
Resource Gathering:
1. System has three trackers for collected data.
    1. Reports from scouting helicopters and SAR teams.
    2. Direct ground-level report from: Live location, User Reports on Website/App.
    3. Reports gathered from news and social media.
    
[SQLite_Database] <br>
Data is to normalised based on the above priority.
1. Auth Data Table: Data from stream 1.
2. User Data Table: Data from stream 2.
3. News Data Table: Data from stream 3.

Data from the above table is processed, normalised, and stored in a MASTER table.
4. Master Table: Stores processed data from table 1, 2, 3.
All the tables above must be updated after every resource allocation and extracting attempt.

5. Log Table: Maintains logs of table (1), (2), and (4).
This can be further utilised to train ML models.
    
6. Priority Log Table: Maintains logs for data generated by PriorityEngine.
